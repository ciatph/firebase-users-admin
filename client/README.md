It aims to:

- demosntrate a simple usage of the Firebase Authentication's CRUD API endpoints described in more detail on the root README.
- demonstrate Firebase Auth user login/logout using the Firebase accounts created by a superadmin (from the CRUD API endpoints, or thru firebase-admin SDK)

### Requirements

1. NodeJS v14.18.3 was used for this project
2. React 18.0
3. Firebase Project
   - with the firebase config script copied over to `/src/utils/firebase.config.js`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
