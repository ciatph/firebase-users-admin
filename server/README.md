## firebase-users-admin

NodeJS backend for handling firebase-admin SDK and CRUD API endpoints, discussed in more detail on the root repository README.

### Notes

We should opt to deploy the backend on Cloud Functions for full-scale production deployments if the Blaze plan is available for the Firebase project rather than Heroku, so we will only work with one cloud infrastructure (Google/Firebase).
